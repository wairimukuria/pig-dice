## Description

this is a website of a pig dice game created which has two players.the game follows the gaming rules where the players take turns to play.player 1 takes a turn and presses the button "roll dice" which allegedly rolls a die and generates a random number.if the number is one,the game automatically switches turns and its the player 2's turn.however if player one scored another value thats not one,their turn continues and the same applies for player 2.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

All the application requires is a text editor to run the code and a web browser of choice by the user to launch it.however the JavaScript and CSS scripts need to be run to ensure proper application functionality.

## Behaviour Driven Development

the application functionality is mostly what is put into first consideration when developing the application .the current score should display and so should the cumulative/total scores.player roles 1 the scores are zero and if player holds the  current scores are recorded.and if a player scores 100 first,he/she is the winner.

## Technologies Used

The application is built on the hypertext markup language(HTML)with the use of custom made stylesheets that use cascading,box models and floats, CSS  using the bootstrap front-end framework plus more custom styles and JavaScript using both JavaScriptand jquery functions for the business and the user interface logic run the specifications of the application and give output.
