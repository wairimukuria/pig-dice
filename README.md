## Description

this is a website created on which the users who are students can take a test by filling multiple choices questions and after submitting they can know what they scored on the website.as a user,i will see multiple choices questions when the website loads  and answer them.each question should have a number of points awarded  when scored.after selecting the answers thought of as correct,the user then submits the test when done and can then see the results of what they scored thereby telling them how they performed.
## Setup/Installation Requirements

All the application requires is a text editor to run the code and a web browser of choice by the user to launch it.however the JavaScript and CSS scripts need to be run to ensure proper application functionality.

## Behaviour Driven Development

the application functionality is mostly what is put into first consideration when developing the application that is factors such as how the user needs to take the test by filling in the questions.in this case the questions are listed and their answers listed using the radio button input type where the user selects the correct answers and submits upon completion.the website then computes the scores based on points attained for every correct answers and outputs the results thereby stating how the user in this case the students performed.

## Technologies Used

The application is built on the hypertext markup language(HTML)with the use of custom made stylesheets that use cascading,box models and floats, CSS  using the bootstrap front-end framework plus more custom styles and JavaScript using both JavaScriptand jquery functions for the business and the user interface logic run the specifications of the application and give output.
